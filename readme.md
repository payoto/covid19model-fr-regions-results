# covid19model-fr-regions-results

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/payoto/covid19model-fr-regions-results/master)

This dataset is a derivative work from the Imperial College Study 
[Estimating the number of infections and the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on COVID-19 in 11 European countries](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-13-europe-npi-impact/).
This repository presents results for the forecasting of the COVID-19 epidemic at French regional level.

The goal of this dataset is to open the access to the result of our simulations, we encourage:

- Suggesting runs, to validate specific behaviours.
- Making visualisation of the data that illustrate reliability.
- Analysis of the performance and forecasting.

This dataset is part of the [data against covid-19](https://opencovid19.fr/)
citizens' initiative for open data and open source code around the COVID-19
pandemic.

## Using this data (in development)

Analysis of the data is facilitated by an example jupyter notebook which
shows usage of the `model_analysis` python package which is under development.

See the [`data_example` notebook](data_example.ipynb) or the
[`model_analysis` package](model_analysis/) for more info.

### Example dataset and visualisation

- Tutorial and explained on how to load data and plot it[`data_example`](data_example.ipynb)
- A short notebook analysing the amount of data after a NPI to ensure convergence [`analysis_report_convergence`](analysis_report_convergence.ipynb)

## Adding to the data

- Fork this repository
- Clone this repository
- Install the git hooks by running:

  .githooks/copy-hooks.sh

- Add the content of the `payoto:covid19model/results/` folder corresponding to successful `--fullrun` executions.
- Do a PR to add to this repository.

## Structure of data

- Data is stored in the `runs/` folder
- Each sub-directory is a "full" run (ran with flag `--full`: 4 chains with 4000 iterations and 2000 repetitions).
- `.csv` files describing the inputs are:
  - `<run name>-inputs-active_regions_ifr.csv` : List of regions considered and the country they are part of, and the IFR used. 
  - `<run name>-base-intervention.csv` : List of NPIs per region considered. 
  - `<run name>-inputs-distribution-parameters.csv` : Configuration of distributions governing transition from infection to hospital and death. 
- Data files describing the finale fitted parameters:
  - `<run name>-covars-alpha-reduction.csv` : Reduction of the `Rt` as a result of each considered NPI (see `.png` file for visualisation). 
  - `<run name>-final-rt.csv` : Final values of `Rt` for each simulation in each region (see `.png` file for visualisation). 
  - `<run name>-final-mu.csv` : Final deviation of `Rt` for each simulation in each region (see `.png` file for visualisation).
- `.csv` files describing the modelled time series and input data:
  - `<run name>-base-plot.csv` : Time series of the fitted data from start time-to simulation time, no forecast.
  - `<run name>-forecast-data.csv` : 7 days time series forecast for each region.

### Detailed description of data files

In progress

#### `-base-plot.csv` - model fit time series

- "" : index
- `"time"` : Date in format `yyyy-mm-dd`.
- `"country"` : Country.
- `"region"` : Geographical region in country.

Other columns are detailed in tabular form below. Notes:

- `<XXX>_c` : denotes a quantity cumulated since the start of the local epidemic;
- modelled data is presented with confidence intervals:
  - `<XXX>_min` : denotes the lower bound of a 95% confidence interval (0.025% band);
  - `<XXX>_max` : denotes the upper bound of a 95% confidence interval (0.975% band);
